# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical design documents and implementation notes from the development of Forge. These files are valuable records of architectural decisions and the evolution of the framework, but they are **not user-facing documentation**.

## What's Here

These documents represent the development process and design iterations:

- **agent-design.md** - Initial agent interface design
- **agent-loop-design.md** - Original agent loop system design
- **agent-loop-flow.md** - Agent loop flow diagrams
- **simplified-agent-loop-design.md** - Revised agent loop design
- **refactored-architecture.md** - Architecture refactoring notes
- **architecture-review.md** - Architecture review and simplification plan
- **code-review-cleanup.md** - Code review and cleanup summary
- **provider-interface-analysis.md** - Provider interface analysis
- **default-agent-architecture.md** - DefaultAgent architecture notes

## Why Archive?

These documents were created during active development to:
- Document design decisions
- Track implementation progress
- Guide architectural changes
- Review and refactor code

They serve as historical context for maintainers and contributors who want to understand **why** certain decisions were made, but they can be confusing for users trying to learn **how to use** the framework.

## For Users

If you're looking to learn how to use Forge, please see:
- [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started/) - Tutorials for newcomers
- [Architecture Documentation](../architecture/) - How the system works
- [API Reference](../reference/) - Complete API documentation
- [How-To Guides](../guides/) - Task-oriented guides

## For Contributors

These archived documents can provide valuable context when:
- Understanding complex design decisions
- Proposing major architectural changes
- Investigating the rationale behind current implementations
- Learning about the evolution of the codebase

However, always refer to the current user-facing documentation and source code as the authoritative reference.
