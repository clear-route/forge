# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-11-02
**Deciders:** Forge Core Team
**Technical Story:** Setting up ADR process for Forge project to document architectural decisions

---

## Context

As Forge grows, we need a way to:
- Document why certain architectural decisions were made
- Provide context for future contributors who weren't part of the original discussions
- Track the evolution of the architecture over time
- Prevent rehashing old discussions without proper context
- Show an evolutionary trail of decisions for auditing and learning purposes

Without a formal process for recording decisions, important context gets lost in closed PRs, Slack conversations, or individual memories. This makes it harder to understand why the codebase is structured the way it is.

### Problem Statement

We need a lightweight, version-controlled way to capture important architectural decisions and their rationale.

### Goals

- Make architectural decisions transparent and accessible
- Provide historical context for decisions
- Enable asynchronous decision-making
- Improve knowledge transfer to new contributors

### Non-Goals

- Document every small code change
- Replace code comments or inline documentation
- Create excessive overhead for small decisions

---

## Decision Drivers

* Need for transparency in decision-making
* Desire to help future contributors understand "why"
* Want to prevent repeated discussions on settled topics
* Keep documentation close to the code (in version control)
* Minimize overhead and bureaucracy

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Description:** Use lightweight markdown files to record significant architectural decisions following Michael Nygard's format.

**Pros:**
- Industry standard approach
- Lightweight and low overhead
- Lives in version control alongside code
- Easy to review in PRs
- Searchable and linkable
- Well-documented format

**Cons:**
- Requires discipline to maintain
- Can become outdated if not kept in sync with code

### Option 2: Wiki/Confluence

**Description:** Use external wiki or documentation platform for architectural decisions.

**Pros:**
- Rich formatting options
- Easy to update
- Good search functionality

**Cons:**
- Separate from code repository
- Not version controlled with code
- Can become disconnected from reality
- Requires separate access/permissions
- May not survive company/platform changes

### Option 3: Comments in Code

**Description:** Document architectural decisions as comments in relevant code files.

**Pros:**
- Directly adjacent to implementation
- Always available when reading code

**Cons:**
- Not discoverable without reading specific files
- Difficult to get overview of all decisions
- Can clutter code
- Hard to maintain chronology
- No single source of truth

### Option 4: No Formal Process

**Description:** Continue without formal documentation of decisions.

**Pros:**
- No overhead
- Maximum flexibility

**Cons:**
- Loss of institutional knowledge
- Repeated discussions
- Harder for new contributors
- Difficult to understand rationale
- No audit trail

## Decision

**Chosen Option:** Option 1 - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Rationale

ADRs strike the best balance between being lightweight and providing value:

1. **Version Control**: ADRs live in the repository, so they're versioned alongside the code they describe
2. **Low Overhead**: Simple markdown format doesn't require special tools
3. **Discoverable**: All ADRs in one directory, easy to browse and search
4. **Industry Standard**: Well-established pattern with good tooling and examples
5. **Git-friendly**: Can be reviewed in PRs just like code
6. **Portable**: Plain text files that will outlive any platform

The format is simple enough that it won't become a burden, but structured enough to ensure consistency.

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- Future contributors can understand why decisions were made
- Architectural discussions have a permanent record
- Easier to onboard new team members
- Less time wasted rehashing old discussions
- Provides accountability for decisions
- Creates a historical record of the project's evolution

### Negative

- Requires discipline to create ADRs for significant decisions
- Need to remember to update/supersede ADRs when decisions change
- Small overhead in the PR process for architectural changes

### Neutral

- ADRs become part of the definition of "done" for architectural work
- Need to establish guidelines for what warrants an ADR

---

## Implementation

### Process

1. When making a significant architectural decision, create a new ADR
2. Copy `template.md` to a new numbered file
3. Fill in all relevant sections
4. Submit as part of the PR implementing the decision
5. Update the index in `README.md`

### What Warrants an ADR?

Create an ADR for decisions that:
- Affect multiple components or the overall architecture
- Have long-term implications
- Involve tradeoffs between competing concerns
- Would be hard to reverse later
- Require explanation beyond code comments

Examples:
- Choosing a data storage approach
- Selecting communication patterns
- Defining core abstractions/interfaces
- Establishing error handling strategies
- Deciding on testing approaches

Do NOT create ADRs for:
- Small implementation details
- Tactical choices with limited scope
- Obvious or uncontroversial decisions
- Decisions that can be easily changed

---

## Validation

### Success Metrics

- New contributors reference ADRs when asking "why" questions
- Reduced time in architectural discussions about previously-decided topics
- Increased confidence in making changes (knowing the context)
- ADRs are created consistently for major decisions

### Monitoring

- Review ADR usage during contributor onboarding
- Track references to ADRs in issues and PRs
- Periodic review of ADR quality and relevance

## Notes

This ADR establishes the foundation for documenting architectural decisions in the Forge project. As we create more ADRs, we'll refine the process and template based on what works best for our team.
