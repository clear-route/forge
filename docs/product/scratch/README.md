## 🎯 Priority Matrix

### Why This Organization?

Each feature idea gets its own file to:
- **Iterate independently** - Develop ideas at their own pace
- **Easy PRD conversion** - Promote ideas to full PRDs when ready
- **Better collaboration** - Multiple people can work on different ideas
- **Version control** - Track evolution of each concept
- **Reduced noise** - Focus on one idea at a time

---

## 🔄 Workflow

**Idea → Scratch → PRD → Implementation**

1. **New Idea**: Create file in scratch/ folder with rough concept
2. **Refinement**: Iterate on idea, add details, examples, technical approach
3. **Validation**: Get feedback, assess feasibility, prioritize
4. **PRD Creation**: Promote mature ideas to full PRD in docs/product/
5. **Implementation**: Build the feature based on PRD

---

## 📝 Template

New scratch files should include:
- Overview and problem statement
- Key capabilities
- Example use cases
- Technical approach (high-level)
- Value propositions
- Open questions
- Related features

---

## Next Steps

1. **LSP Integration Prototype**: Build basic LSP integration for Go
2. **User Research**: Validate feature priorities with users
3. **Technical Feasibility**: Assess implementation complexity
4. **Roadmap Planning**: Sequence features based on dependencies
5. **PRD Development**: Create full PRDs for top 3 features

**Note:** These are living documents. Add ideas, refine concepts, and update priorities as we learn from users and market.
