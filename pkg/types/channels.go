// AgentChannels defines the communication channels between an agent and its executor.
// These channels enable async, event-driven communication.

	// The agent emits various events (thinking, messages, tool calls, errors, etc.) on this channel.
	Event chan *AgentEvent

	// The executor closes this channel to initiate graceful shutdown.
