# Simple Agent Example

This is a basic example demonstrating how to use the Forge agent framework.

## Overview

This example shows the minimal setup required to create and run an agent using Forge.

## Running the Example

```bash
# From the repository root
go run examples/simple-agent/main.go

# Or using make
make run-example
```

## What This Example Demonstrates

- Basic framework initialization
- Agent creation (to be implemented)
- Executor setup (to be implemented)
- Simple agent execution flow (to be implemented)

## Next Steps

As the framework develops, this example will be updated to show:
1. LLM provider configuration
2. Agent initialization
3. Tool/function calling
4. Conversation handling

## Development

This example is also used as a development harness for testing framework features
during development.
