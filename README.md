**Forge** is an open-source, lightweight agent framework for building AI agents with pluggable components. It provides a clean, modular architecture that makes it easy to create agents with different LLM providers and execution environments.

## Features

- ðŸ”Œ **Pluggable Architecture**: Interface-based design for maximum flexibility
- ðŸ¤– **LLM Provider Abstraction**: Support for OpenAI-compatible APIs with extensibility for custom providers
- ðŸš€ **Execution Plane Abstraction**: Run agents in different environments (CLI, API, custom)
- ðŸ“¦ **Library-First Design**: Import as a Go module in your own applications
- ðŸ§ª **Well-Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage with continuous integration
- ðŸ“– **Well-Documented**: Clear documentation and examples

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/entrhq/forge
```

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/entrhq/forge/pkg/agent"
    "github.com/entrhq/forge/pkg/llm"
    "github.com/entrhq/forge/pkg/executor"
)

func main() {
    // 1. Create an LLM provider
    provider := llm.NewOpenAIProvider(config)
    
    // 2. Create an agent with the provider
    agent := agent.New(provider, options)
    
    // 3. Create an executor
    executor := executor.NewCLI()
    
    // 4. Run the agent
    executor.Run(agent)
}
```

## Architecture

Forge is built with a clean, modular architecture:

- **Agent Core** ([`pkg/agent`](pkg/agent)): Core agent interface and functionality
- **LLM Providers** ([`pkg/llm`](pkg/llm)): Pluggable LLM provider implementations
- **Executors** ([`pkg/executor`](pkg/executor)): Different execution environments for agents
- **Configuration** ([`pkg/config`](pkg/config)): Centralized configuration management
- **Types** ([`pkg/types`](pkg/types)): Shared types and interfaces

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for detailed architecture documentation.
